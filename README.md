### Hi there, I'm Anna! I'm a Full-Stack Developer and 3rd year Computer Science Major at UC Irvine. 


I'm really passionate about *web/app development* and creating projects for social good but I love learning about new concepts from various fields. Currently, I've been interested in learning more about *artificial intelligence* and *cybersecurity*!

Feel free to contact me at [annachan.nb@gmail.com](mailto:annachan.nb@gmail.com).
